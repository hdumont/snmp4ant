Changes from 1.4 to 1.5 (Snmp4Ant additions) Marc Adams

- Created a "test" source folder to implement unit tests. Unit tests will be added slowly.

- Added packages to the class structure to enforce standards and best practices

- Replaced deprecated Swing methods show() and hide() with setVisible(true) and setVisible(false) repsectively

- Added annotations to suppress warnings on unused methods and variables.

- Added generated Serial IDs for serializable classes.

- Added generics to arrays and collections for JDK 1.5 compliance

Changes from version 1.3 to 1.4:

- Replaced SNMPInteger values in Get and GetNext requests with SNMP Nulls

- Changed SNMP TimeTicks in trap sender timestamp to 1/100ths of second rather 
  than 1/1000ths
  
- Restricted SNMPTimeTicks to be 32-bit quantity (rather than arbitrarily large, 
  which caused problems with some receivers)

- Added PrintWriter for error reporting in AgentListener and TrapListener interfaces
  so error reporting can be directed as desired (rather than always to System.out)
  
- Changed internal representation of SNMPObjectIdentifier to array of longs to accept
  OID components up to 2^32 - 1 (thanks to Norman Elton)
  
- Changed toString() methods to utilize StringBuffer internally, for efficiency 
  (thanks to Philip Yarra)
  
- Added radix specification to SNMPInteger class toString() method

- Improved error handling:
  - Messages and PDUs perform more detailed qualification of contents, reporting more 
    specific errors (rather than passing on generic Java exception types)
  - Agent Interface now catches and reports all exceptions

- Fixed bug in SNMPv1AgentInterface, in which handled OIDs checked by reference 
  rather than by value (thanks to Roman Levandovsky)

- Added equals() and hashCode() methods to SNMP object subclasses for use in collections

- Added support for SNMPv2 traps and inform request messages. Note that as a result the
  1.4 version of the package is not directly backward-compatible with the 1.3 version,
  as all classes related to trap messages have been qualified to indicate whether the
  trap is a v1 or v2 trap. Thus applications which use traps will need to be changed
  to use the 1.4 version package; however, the changes should be simple textual 
  substitutions, e.g., changing all references to SNMPTrapPDU to SNMPv1TrapPDU.

- Added build scripts for GNU Make and Apache Ant
